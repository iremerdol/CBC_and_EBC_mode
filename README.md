## CBC_and_EBC_mode
  This is our project for the PRINCIPLES OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY, this project mainly focuses on encrypting our input picture and create a corresponding crypted image.
  Input file has to be *.png format.
  
    In order to run the jar executable:
    Open command prompt and locate the file. After that you type this line:
      java -jar --enable-preview activity4.jar
    Then you press the select image button and select image you desire to encrypt (you can type the path if you want). You can press the ECB or CBC encryption buttons to see the encrypted version to the image.
